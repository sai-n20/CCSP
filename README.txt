This folder contains the following:

  A C++ directed graph class in file Graph.h.  The class
    uses an adjacency list data structure and allows
    two edge weights.  It also includes member functions
    which implement various fundamental graph algorithms.

  Several driver programs which read graphs and apply
    particular algorithms.  See, for example dfs.cpp

  Several input files encoding graphs in a simple but
    flexible format.  Sample graph files have a .g 
    extension.

  A makefile which compiles the various executables.
